# Assignment 2: System Calls

## System Calls Understanding

### fork

* Main Functionality: Creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.  The new process is referred to as the child
                      process.  The calling process is referred to as the parent process.
* Function Argument: /

### stat

* Main Functionality: displays file or file system status
* Function Argument: 
    - const char *pathname: path to the file of the information
    - struct stat *statbuf: return buffer

### kill

* Main Functionality: send a signal to a process
* Function Argument:
    - pid_t pid: ID of the process the signal will be sent to
    - int sig: signal to be sent

### mmap

* Main Functionality: creates  a  new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling process
* Function Argument:
    - void *addr: starting address for the new mapping
    - site_t length: length of the mapping (>0)
    - int prot: desired memory protection of the mapping
    - int flags: determines whether updates to the mapping are visible to other processes mapping the same region & whether updates are carried through to the underlying file
    - int fd: file descriptor
    - off_t offset: the starting offset of the file

### chmod

* Main Functionality: changes the file mode bits of each given file
       according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number repre‚Äê
       senting the bit pattern for the new mode bits
* Function Argument:
    - const char *pathname: path to the file of the mode to be changed
    - mode_t mode: new file mode

### waitpid

* Main Functionality:  waits for state changes in a child of the calling process, and obtains
       information about the child whose state has changed
* Function Argument:
    - pid_t pid: child waited for to change state
    - int *wstatus: status information is stored in the int it points to (!NULL)
    - int options: for modifying the behavior to wait for terminated children only




## System Calls Fail

### fork

* Condition: not enough memory (to allocate the necessary kernel structures)


### exec

* Condition: denied permission for a file


### unlink

* Condition: search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix, or write permission is denied on the directory containing the directory entry to be removed


### read

* Condition: call was interrupted by a signal before any data was read


### mount

* Condition: one of the pointer arguments points outside the user address space


### chmod

* Condition: too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving path


### kill

* Condition: invalid signal was specified


## Trap

 A trap instruction is a procedure call that synchronously transfers the control. It is a software interrupt 
 generated by the user program or by an error when the operating system is needed by it to perform the system calls
 or an operation. This means, that a trap instruction used to switch from the user mode of the system to the kernel mode.
